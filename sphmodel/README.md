# SphModel
-----------------------

`SphModel` is a subpackage of `SphGLLTools`, a toolbox for visualization, processing, sharing, and spherical harmonics analysis of tomographic models defined on GLL meshes.

## Installation
-----------------------

`SphModel` requires no installation. Just take the following steps:

1. Make sure you have:

* GCC 5.5.0 or greater;
* Python 2.7.12 or greater;
* GMT 6.0.0 or greater;

2. Download the latest version of YOUR_MODEL_NAME from YOUR_WEB_LINK

3. Untar the crustal block model using:

```sh
$ for file in crust/*tar.xz; do tar -xvJf "$file" -C crust/; done
```

4. Run the Makefile with:

```sh
$ make
```

## Usage
-----------------------

All routines have a help menu that shows up wherever you run them with no or with a wrong number of command-line parameters. The
same menu is also at the beginning of each source code. For more details, please, refer to the manual of `SphGLLTools`.

## Development
-----------------------

Development is hosted on GitHub in the [caio.ciardelli/sphglltools repository](https://github.com/caiociardelli/sphglltools).

## Model parametrization
-----------------------

This parametrization includes Vpv (km/s), Vph (km/s), Vsv (km/s), Vsh (km/s), Eta, and Rho (g/cm^3). The perturbations for the default parameters, as well as some derived parameters such as the isotropic velocities (Vp and Vs), the bulk sound speed, the Vp/Vs ratios, and the transverse isotropy, can also be computed using these routines.

The model is composed of four zones:

Zone 1: Represents the crust using a block model. The horizontal resolution is 0.5 degrees, both in latitude and longitude, and the vertical resolution is 1 km. This zone stretches from 5 km above sea level to 80 km depth.

Zone 2: Represents the upper mantle using a combination of spherical harmonics of various degrees and six cubic B-splines. This zone stretches from 80 km to 410 km depth.

Zone 3: Represents the transition zone using a combination of spherical harmonics of various degrees and five cubic B-splines. This zone stretches from 410 km to 650 km depth.

Zone 4: Represents the lower mantle using a combination of spherical harmonics of various degrees and fourteen cubic B-splines. This zone stretches from 650 km to 2891 km depth.
