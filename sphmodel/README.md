# SphModel
-----------------------

`SphModel` is a subpackage of `SphGLLTools`, a toolbox for visualization, processing and spherical harmonics analysis of tomographic models defined on GLL meshes.

Author: Caio Ciardelli

If you use SphModel, please, cite the following paper:

## Installation
-----------------------

Instructions on how to install and use `SphModel` are available in the PDF manual of `SphGLLTools`: User_Manual.pdf

## Development
-----------------------

Development is hosted on GitHub in the [caio.ciardelli/sphglltools repository](https://github.com/caio.ciardelli/sphglltools).

# Model parametrization
-----------------------

This parametrization includes PARAMETERS (UNITIES) (e.g. Vp (km/s), Vs (km/s) and Rho (g/cm^3)). The perturbations for the above mentioned parameters as well as some derived parameters such as bulk sound speed, Vp/Vs ratios and transverse isotropy can also be computed using these routines.

The model is separated in four zones:

Zone 1: Represents the crust using a block model. The horizontal resolution is ? degrees both in latitude 
and longitude. The vertical resolution is ? km. This zone stretches from ? km above sea level to ? km depth.

Zone 2: Represents the upper mantle using a combination of spherical harmonics up to degree ? and ? cubic 
B-splines. This zone stretches from ? km to ? km depth.

Zone 3: Represents the transition zone using a combination of spherical harmonics up to degree ? and ? cubic 
B-splines. This zone stretches from ? km to ? km depth.

Zone 4: Represents the lower mantle using a combination of spherical harmonics up to degree ? and ? cubic 
b-splines. This zone stretches from ? km to ? km depth.

# Usage
-----------------------

All routines have a help menu that shows up wherever you run them with no or with a wrong number of command-line parameters. The
same menu is also at the beginning of each source code. For more details, please, refer to the manual of `SphGLLTools`.
