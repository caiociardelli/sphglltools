 GETINFO

 USAGE
   ./bin/getinfo FILENAME

 EXAMPLE
   ./bin/getinfo vp_VCS.dat

 COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS
   FILENAME              - name of the grid file

 DESCRIPTION
   Reads a grid file and outputs the minimum and the maximum values, the mean, and the standard
   deviation. For all the computations, this routine ignores zeroes in the grid. The reason for
   that is because the main propose of this routine is providing information to create the color
   bars in the plotting routines. Zeroes almost always represent null values, corresponding to
   regions outside the mesh and, hence, are not meaningful.
